📧 Automated Email Sender in Python  

**🔧 Technologies Used**:  
- **`smtplib`** for SMTP protocol integration  
- **`email.message`** for MIME-compliant email construction  
- **`python-dotenv`** for secure environment variable management  
- **Structured logging** with Python’s `logging` module  

**✨ Key Features**:  
- **🔒 Secure Credential Management**: Leverages `.env` files to isolate sensitive data, ensuring compliance with security best practices.  
- **⏰ Flexible Execution Modes**: Supports both **scheduled (cron-like)** and **event-driven** workflows for seamless automation.  
- **🚦 Robust Error Handling**: Implements try-catch blocks with custom exceptions for graceful failure recovery.  
- **📊 Logging & Auditing**: Detailed log files for debugging and operational transparency.  
- **📨 Dynamic Email Composition**: Programmatically constructs multipart emails (plaintext/HTML) with attachments.  

**🚀 Use Cases**:  
- Automated notifications (e.g., system alerts, reports)  
- Batch email campaigns with personalized content  
- Integration into CI/CD pipelines for deployment alerts  

**⚙️ Architecture**:

Modular design adhering to **SOLID principles**, with decoupled components for SMTP communication, message templating, and scheduler orchestration.
